# Billboard

Billboard is a Mac OS X screen saver forked from [Countdown](https://github.com/soffes/Countdown). You can use it to display supported forms configurated by a remote JSON file.

You can configure the JSON file once you picked it in Screen Saver Preferences in System Preferences.

## Installation

If you see a message saying this screen saver doesn't work with this version of OS X and you have 10.11 or higher, just quit System Preferences and relaunch it. The screen savers is pretty buggy when it comes to screen savers written in Swift.

## Building

Xcode 8.0 is required to build Billboard since it has been updated to Swift 3.0.
